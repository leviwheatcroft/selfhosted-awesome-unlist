<p><strong>Socioboard</strong> is world’s first open source social technology enabler and first open source product company from India. We build social technology which helps businesses and brands to better understand social media and harness its real power.
Our vision is to provide easy to use tools to businesses and brands which covers 360 degree use cases when it comes to Social Media.</p>
<p>We are building innovative products for various social networks which fill the critical gap - Social Networks were meant for user’s not for businesses. Our tools and products view Social from a business point of view and fill those gaps which social networks cannot fill exquisitely.
Business should own their social data and they should be incharge of what they want to do with it, generate reports and analyze data to make informed and improved business decisions. This is possible when things are open and businesses have freedom to choose, we believe open source is a way to make this possible. So that brands and businesses can embrace social technology with an open mind in an open and connected world.</p>
<p>We believe in providing our users with choice, we don’t push useless buggy bloatware to their throat and force them to pay for it. </p>
<p>Our products resonate with our vision to make social technologies more open.</p>

<h1 id="why-open-source-">Why Open Source ?</h1>
<p>There are many great tools available for managing social media programs, from content management systems to analytics tools. But many of the systems available are rigid in their architecture, and cannot be customized to meet the specific editorial, workflow, and governance needs of various organizations. By creating a customizable, open source alternative, teams can model their system on the way they operate in the real world.</p>
<p>There is too much focus on vanity metrics. Marketers don’t focus on driving business results through social media. Brands are still using social media as a broadcast channel.</p>
<p>Social media marketers face the difficulty to access technology that is flexible enough to meet their needs for approval workflow, compliance, asset management, moderation, etc. The tools available for managing social media are often lacking, and perpetuate the issues in social media marketing by overemphasizing broadcasting content and vanity metrics.Marketers don’t focus on driving business results through social media. Brands are still using social media as a broadcast channel.</p>
<p>Open-source is a revolution in an industry which is mostly dominated by big names, in other words it’s a boon in an industry which generally talks about hefty amounts from end users. With many organizations reaching out to open source it is undoubtedly becoming clear that price is not the only advantage which open-source holds against proprietary softwares. We have listed some distinct compelling advantages for business users as well as individuals:
    Security : The more open the code is the more possibilities it holds to be tested in field and hence the more secure it can be made as is evident by example of Linux distributions. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Quality :</strong> Thousands of developers contributing across international borders will obviously produce better quality outcome than a handful of developers. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Customizability :</strong> Users can take a piece of open source software and tweak it to suit their needs as they please. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom :</strong> Open-source gives freedom from nasty vendor lock-in which people have to endure with proprietary softwares. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility :</strong> Open source softwares are typically much less resource-intensive, meaning that people can run it well even on older hardware. It&#39;s up to end user not some vendor to decide when it&#39;s time to upgrade. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interoperability :</strong> Open source software is much better at degree of interoperability vis a vis proprietary software. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Auditability :</strong> The visibility of the code behind open source software means you can see for yourself and be confident about the quality and functionality. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Try Before You Buy :</strong> Costs nothing to try. No commitment required until you&#39;re sure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
