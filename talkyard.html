<h3 id="recent-replies--find-them">Recent replies â€” find them:</h3>
<p>You leave for lunch, or go home over the night â€” and return to a Question-Answers topic the next day. Did someone post more replies, when you were away? You want to find and read?</p>
<p>You can directly find the most recent answers and replies: Open the sidebar, click the Recent tab, and find the most recent replies, click to scroll.</p>
<p>(But at StackOverflow, Reddit, HackerNews etc, it&#39;s hard to find them (since the discussions are threaded). You need to carefully scan the whole discussion from top to bottom.)</p>

<p>Notifications via email, as of now. Some time later, there&#39;ll be a PWA mobile app with push notifications.</p>

<!--
Currently, Talkyard is a mobile friendly web app.
Within half a year or a year (today is August 2018),
the plan is that there'll be a white labelled mobile app.
Meaning, people will be able to install your community, on their mobile phones,
as a separate app with your custom icon.
Push notifications for Android
(however, initially not for iPhone â€” iPhone currently cannot do PWA mobile app push notifications).

<p>Say hello in the community: <a href="https://www.talkyard.io/forum/">https://www.talkyard.io/forum/</a>.</p>
<!--
Good for you if you ask the people there what is currently being worked on, so you won't
accidentally re-implement something that's almost done already â€” people
might be working in their own work-in-progress topic branches that you
don't know about. -->

<p>How to translate to a new language: <a href="translations/i18n-README.md">i18n-README</a> (step 1 and 2 only).</p>
<p>You need to agree to <a href="./docs/CLA-v2.txt">this Contributor License Agreement</a>. You do that by
reading it (there&#39;s a human friendly intro) and appending a single line
paragraph with your real name (no pseudonyms) and the following text, to all your commit messages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, Your Full Name &lt;your@<i></i>email.address&gt;, agree to the Contributor License Agreement, docs/CLA-v2.txt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please squash your commits to just one (unless you&#39;re doing something that&#39;s easier
to review in separate commits).</p>

And an internet connection â€” you&#39;ll download perhaps 1 GB Docker images and other files.</p>
<p>Install Docker and Docker-Compose, see: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/</a>.
On Linux, you can:</p>
<pre><code>sudo -i
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh
sh install-docker.sh
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version  # should print &quot;docker-compose version ... build ...&quot;</code></pre><p>Read <a href="docs/intro-to-docker-compose.md">A brief intro to Docker-Compose</a> â€” unless you know

<li><p>Append some settings to the system config, so ElasticSearch will work.
ElasticSearch will get downloaded later, in a Docker image (don&#39;t install it yourself).

<li><p>Start Talkyard:</p>
<p>  make up</p>
</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<pre><code>And have a coffee; `make up` takes a while: Git submodules and Node.js packages will get downloaded,
Typescript, Stylus and Scala code gets compiled and packaged, Docker images get built.
You can tail the log messages, by typing `make tail`,
or `sudo s/d logs -f`.  (s/d means &quot;scripts&quot; and &quot;docker-compose&quot;)

The following log message might take 10 - 20 minutes: (to download things)

    Loading project definition from /opt/talkyard/app/project

Wait for these &quot;Server started&quot; log messages to appear:

    app_1  |
    app_1  | --- (Running the application, auto-reloading is enabled) ---
    app_1  |
    app_1  | [info] p.c.s.NettyServer - Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000

<li><p>Point your browser to <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>. This sends a request to the Docker container
named &#39;web&#39;, in which Nginx listens on port 80. Nginx sends the request to Play Framework
in the &#39;app&#39; container, port 9000. Play Framework then starts compiling more Scala files â€” this
take a little while; the browser might show a 502 Bad Gateway error message.</p>
<p>Soon, when done compiling, Play Framework will start. Then this gets logged:</p>
<pre><code>app_1  | [info] application - Starting... [TyMHELLO]
...
...
app_1  | [info] application - Started. [TyMSTARTED]</code></pre><p>If you don&#39;t see these messages (maybe they scroll past too fast), you can
continue with the next step just below anyway â€” just keep reloading the browser page until
any &quot;is starting&quot; message in the browser window disappears.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a forum</p>
<p>Reload the browser at <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>. A page with a button should appear.
Sign up as admin with this email: <code>admin@example.com</code> (must be that email).
As username and password you can type <code>admin</code> and <code>public1234</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- Not needed any longer.
   You'll be asked to confirm your email address, by clicking a link in an email
   that was sent to you â€” but in fact the email couldn't be sent, because you haven't configured
   any email server, and `admin@example.com` isn't your address anyway.

   Instead look at the log messages. (Run `sudo docker-compose logs app` if you've closed
   the terminal with log messages.) There you'll find
   the email â€” it's written to the log files, in development mode. Copy the
   confirmation link from the `<a href=...>` and paste it in the browser's address bar.

<p>Shut down everything like so: <code>make dead</code>.</p>
<h2 id="editing-source-code">Editing source code</h2>
<h3 id="typescript">Typescript</h3>
<p>To edit Typescript code (in <code>client/app-*/</code>) you can use VSCode.</p>
<p>If you edit some code and reload the page in the browser, your changes will
appear automatically: there&#39;s a Docker container, named Gulp, with Node.js
installed, which recompile Typescript and Stylus CSS. â€”
If you edit Typescript, wait five seconds before you reload the page in
the browser, otherwise the Typescript code might not yet have been transpiled.</p>
<h3 id="scala">Scala</h3>
<p>To edit Scala code (in <code>app/*</code>), you can use IntelliJ IDEA, the free community edition.
Don&#39;t forget to install a Java Development Kit (JDK) â€” in Debian 9:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install default-jdk  # installs JDK 8</code></pre><p>There&#39;s a container, named <em>app</em>, which runs the Play Framework application server,
and looks for changes to Scala files, recompiles and reloads.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you keep editing and reloading Scala files many many times, then eventually
Play Framework runs out of memory. Restart it like so: <code>make restart-app</code>.</p>
<h2 id="building-your-own-images">Building your own images</h2>
<p>Do this: (<code>make</code> is GNU Make)</p>
<pre><code>vi version.txt    # type a new vesion number
vi .env           # change DOCKER_REPOSITORY to your own repository
make prod-images  # this runs tests and builds production images
make tag-and-push-latest-images tag=...  # pushes images to your repo</code></pre><p>You can type <code>make</code> to see help about the Makefile targets.</p>
<p>All this has been tested in Ubuntu and Mint Linux only, with Bash. If you&#39;re
on Windows, probably you&#39;ll need <a href="https://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
or <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a>.</p>

<h3 id="css-classes-and-ids">CSS classes and ids</h3>
<p><em>Example</em>: <code>s_P_By_FN-Gst</code>. Here, <code>s_</code> is a prefix used for all classes, and
it means &quot;some&quot;. For ids we use <code>t_</code> instead, means &quot;the&quot;. <code>P</code> means Post. <code>By</code> means
who-was-it-written-By. <code>FN</code> means Full Name. <code>Gst</code> means Guest.</p>
<p>So, this is BEM (Block Element Modifier) with a few tweaks: Blocks/elements are separated with
only one underscore, and modifiers with only one dash. Blocks, elems and modifiers always
start with uppercase â€” because then it&#39;s easy to tell if we&#39;re dealing with an <em>abbreviation</em>
or not. For example, <code>FN</code> (full name) is an abbreviation. But <code>By</code> is not (since it continues with
lowercase letters).</p>
<p>Another example: <code>s_Dfs_Df_Ttl</code> â€” this means the title (Ttl), of a draft (Df),
in a list of drafts (Dfs).  You&#39;ll find abbreviations like Ttl and Df, in
<a href="./docs/bem-blocks.txt">bem-blocks.txt</a>.</p>
<!-- I think these short names actually improve readability, once you know what they means.
Seeing `s_Dfs_Df_Ttl` in the source code â€” that's brief and quick to read, doesn't steal
the attention from other things nearby you're probably more inteested in.
(too chatty, skip this)  -->

<p>For stuff with otherwise no class or id, and that should be clicked in end-to-end tests,
we use classes only, and the prefix <code>e_</code> (instead of <code>s_</code> or <code>t_</code>).</p>
<h3 id="single-and-double-quotes">Single and double quotes</h3>
<p>In Typescript (and any Javascript), use single quotes for strings the computer cares about,
like CSS classes or ids, e.g. <code>className: &#39;s_P&#39;</code> or <code>reactRenderMethod = &#39;hydrate&#39;</code>,
or React component display names.
For texts that humans read, instead use double quotes, like: <code>Button({ ...}, &quot;Undo&quot;)</code>.
When doing this, you can be fairly certain that if you edit a single quote string,
without knowing what you&#39;re doing, something will break.
Whilst if you edit a double quoted string and fix e.g. a spelling errors: the computer
won&#39;t care, but humans like it.</p>
<h3 id="tag-the-code">Tag the code</h3>
<p>Some parts of a software system, knows how other parts of the software system works,
sometimes in not-obvious ways. Make such otherwise hidden duplicated knowledge visible,
by tagging the code with tags like: <code>[1ABCDE2]</code>.
Example: <code>// Also done here: [4JKAM7] when deleting pages.</code>.
Or there&#39;s a 3rd partly lib bug workaround in one source code file, for a problem that happens
in a different file, and an end-to-end test that got affected, example: <code>[5QKBRQ]</code>.
Tag those three places with the same tag.
Just type a number, random uppercase letters, and another number, to create a tag.
And copy-paste it to where the related code is.</p>
<h3 id="message-codes-and-magic-underscores">Message codes and magic underscores</h3>
<p>Log messages, and plain text messages sent back to the browser, start with <code>TyM</code> if it&#39;s
an info message, and <code>TyE</code> if it&#39;s an error. Like, <code>&quot;Started. [TyMSTARTED]&quot;</code> (a log message).</p>
<p>These messsage codes helps you instantly find the relevat source code, if there&#39;s
an error message anywhere. Otherwise, it can be terribly annoying,
when the browser says &quot;Not found&quot;, and you have no idea where that message comes from.
For example, Nginx didn&#39;t find a location handler? Or a user is missing? Or a page? Or a post?
Or a client side route is missing? Or the hostname is wrong? Or ...?
And you search for &quot;Not found&quot; and find 1 000 matches.
Now, instead, you&#39;ll see <code>&quot;Not found [TyE123ABC]&quot;</code> â€” and you then search for &quot;TyE123ABC&quot;
and find the relevant source code.</p>
<p>Some message codes sent to the browser are checked for in end to end tests. They shall
have an underscore <code>_</code> at the <em>end</em> (because it&#39;s called <em>end</em> to <em>end</em> tests). So, if you see a
message code like: <code>&quot;TyM0APPR_&quot;</code> and you change it, you need to search for it
everywhere and update some end-to-end tests too.</p>
<p>Some message codes are checked for by production code Typescript, i.e. <em>front</em>end code.
They shall have a <code>_</code> at the beginnign (front) of the error code, and here&#39;s how they can be used
server side: <code>throwForbidden(&quot;_TyE403BPWD&quot;, &quot;Bad username or password&quot;)</code> and
client side: <code>if (xhr.responseText.indexOf(&#39;_TyE403BPWD&#39;) ...</code>. â€” So, when you&#39;re looking at the
server side code the <code>_</code> tells you that the error code is used in the frontend Typescript code,
so you cannot just change it.</p>
<h3 id="database-tables-constraints-index-names">Database tables, constraints, index names</h3>
<p>Add &quot;as many constraints and foreign keys as you can&quot;. Knowing precisely what&#39;s in the
database, makes data migrations safer &amp; simpler. Don&#39;t forget to index
foreign key columns. Type <code>ix: index-name</code> next to the foreign key constraints,
so one directly sees that there&#39;s an index, and its name. All fk constraints should
be deferrable.</p>
<p><strong>Table names:</strong> <code>some_table3</code>. The trailing digit &quot;3&quot; is for historical reasons â€”
maybe change to &quot;_t&quot; instead? <em>Some</em> suffix is needed, so one can search
for <code>table_name3</code> e.g. <code>pages3</code> and find only the <em>table</em>, instead of 999 999
other unrelated &quot;table_name&quot; e.g. &quot;pages&quot; search hits.</p>
<p><strong>Unique indexes:</strong> <code>tablename_u_columnone_coltwo_three...</code></p>
<p><strong>Non-unique indexes:</strong> <code>tablename_i_colone_coltwo_three...</code></p>
<p><strong>Foreign keys:</strong> <code>tablename_colone_coltwo_..._r_othertable(_col_coltwo_...)</code></p>
<p><strong>Check constraints:</strong> <code>tablename_c_...sth-to-check...</code> e.g. <code>pages_c_id_len</code> (length).</p>
<p>It&#39;s nice to have these one letter object types: <code>_u</code>, <code>_i</code>, <code>_c</code> because then they&#39;re
more full text searchable â€” e.g. find all usages of any (unique) indexes on a certain
table, accross the whole code base. And you soon learn to recognize what they mean so you know
what type of thing it is, without having to think or find out. Having them directly
after the table name (without the &#39;3&#39; suffix) makes things nicely aligned &amp; easy to scan,
when typing <code>\d some_table_name</code> in the psql client.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;d be nice if all column names ended with &quot;_c&quot;? E.g. <code>username_c</code>.
Because currently they&#39;re a bit hard to search for. Instead one needs to search
for the table name, and then look for the column name, in the surrounding code.</p>
<p>Most db things don&#39;t follow these naming standards, because I (KajMagnus) had different
ideas in the past. Maybe one day, time to rename everything to the correct names?</p>
<h3 id="hen-and-henbirds">Hen and henbirds</h3>
<p>Source code comments should be concise, but writing &quot;he or she&quot; everywhere, when referring
to e.g. a user, becomes a bit verbose (because &quot;he or she&quot; is three words). There&#39;s
a short Swedish word that means &quot;he or she&quot;, namely &quot;hen&quot;. Let&#39;s start using it in English.</p>
<p>So: &quot;hen&quot; = either &quot;he or she&quot;, or &quot;him or her&quot;, depending on context.
And &quot;hens&quot; = &quot;his or her&quot;, and &quot;hen&#39;s&quot; = &quot;he or she is&quot;.</p>
<p>To refer to many hen = many-he-or-she, write &quot;people&quot;. &quot;Hens&quot; however
means &quot;his or her&quot;, just like &quot;its&quot; means, well, &quot;its&quot; (but not &quot;things&quot;).</p>
<p>What about the bird previously called &quot;hen&quot;? Let&#39;s call it &quot;henbird&quot; instead.</p>
<p>So, hereafter, the word &quot;hen&quot; means &quot;he or she&quot;. And the henbird, which I cannot
remember having mentioned or even thought about the past year, no longer gets
to occupy the short and useful word &quot;hen&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="custom-third-party-builds">Custom third party builds</h2>
<p>We&#39;re building &amp; using a smaller version of Lodash, like so:
(this makes slim-bundle.min.js.gz 8kb = 4% smaller, as of September 2016)</p>
<pre><code># COULD create custom typedef for this custom Lodash, so won&#39;t accidentally use

# and scroll down towards the bottom. Look at the line `lodash.cloneDeep =` and below:
# did any function unexpectedly disappear? If so, include it in the long list above
# and regenerate `lodash-custom.js`.</code></pre><ul>
<li>For security reasons, we checkin only the resulting <code>.js</code> file (but not the <code>.min.js</code>) file
into source control (so that you can read the source code and see what it does).</li>
<li>There are some Gulp plugins that builds Lodash but one seems abandonend (gulp-lodash-builder)
and the other (gulp-lodash-custom) analyzes all .js files, I guess that&#39;d slow down the build
rather much + won&#39;t immediately work with Typescript?</li>
