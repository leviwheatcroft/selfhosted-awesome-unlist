<li>UPDATED: BigTree::cURL now allows output to a file for less memory-intensive file downloads</li>
<li>CHANGED: Field drawing and field processing now occurs in function scope with access to $admin, $bigtree, $cms, and $field. This limits the likelihood of one field type somehow breaking the main form&#39;s environment variables and also leads to much better code re-use.</li>

<li>FIXED: Lots of general JavaScript clean-up</li>
<li>BACKWARDS COMPATIBILTY: BigTree 4.1 packages that use the Array of Items field type for forms/templates/callouts/settings will need to have that field changed manually to a Matrix field after importing.</li>

<li>UPDATED: BigTree::cURL now allows output to a file for less memory-intensive file downloads</li>
<li>CHANGED: Field drawing and field processing now occurs in function scope with access to $admin, $bigtree, $cms, and $field. This limits the likelihood of one field type somehow breaking the main form&#39;s environment variables and also leads to much better code re-use.</li>

<li>REMOVED: Array of Items field type -- existing fields will be automatically converted to Matrix but their display titles will be lost until they are re-saved.</li>
<li>FIXED: Lots of general JavaScript clean-up</li>
<li>BACKWARDS COMPATIBILTY: BigTree 4.1 packages that use the Array of Items field type for forms/templates/callouts/settings will need to have that field changed manually to a Matrix field after importing.</li>
